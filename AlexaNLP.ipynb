problems whatsoever, alexa. thank you.', 'i like my uncle. but sometime it goes a little haywire', 'bought this for my son and it didn’t work. he had to return it.', 'bought 2 and both quit connecting

(as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!set up with the dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone’s wifi settings. i called amazon customer service, and i dunno what it is, but lately i’ve been getting terrible support. the guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.i’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong. reconnecting is a pain each time as well.all that said, when alexa works, she works amazingly well. i don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing i really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. one of the more annoying limitations of apple’s siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “hey siri” feature is all but useless. alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. i haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so i’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your led devices (eg. rainbow effects), alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to

great start. alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my sirrius/xm account. good daily stuff. good sound, but not bose. but, the ads say &#34;hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. well, not so. i understand there will be some differences in product device  support. the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge. so, it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs

hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus.  everything i tried, ended in a discovery failed message.  i tried to set this up over and over and over again.  i watched youtube videos.  i read set up websites.  i was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support.  i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  this product has tested my patience.  so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.the only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb.  the problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, i purchased another bulb and still alexa couldn't locate this device.i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating, but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo?  the support person had the same thought.  maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can't get over the look of that hub.  it looks like a defuser.i can't believe i didn't find youtube videos that show the problems i did.  everything looked simple and seamless...not the experience i had.  ok, i'm done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already.\", 'got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. it sounds pretty good and works well so far.', 'very nice and its does not take up space', \"i'm an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i've always loved it. i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus. let me tell you what, great choice! as much as i love my original echo, the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. the sound is great. and the fact that it's got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus!\", 'received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. thank you amazon.', 'i’m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn’t work, the timer doesn’t ends... and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.', 'love it just wish i could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription', 'sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub.  the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs.', \"i got it to try side by side with the echo originale. they are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. as many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue, z wave or anything else. it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. for me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i don't really need the hub with less functionality. in addition, i don't think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs. net net for me, this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good. with the  original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.\", \"why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with samsung tv's and many other devices?  i want my money back!  this thing won't even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub.

that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  when playing  music with  bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs.', 'i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  when i got everything set up, i realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  all it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  it will not change colors.  you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  i wish i’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had

technology.i have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. it's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo (2nd generation).the piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.this order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought. i put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all i had to do was say &#34;alexa, connect my devices&#34;. the default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;first light&#34; and &#34;second light&#34;, so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. in the alexa app, i created a 'group' with &#34;first light&#34; and &#34;second light&#34; and named the group &#34;the light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say &#34;alexa, turn on the light&#34;.i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub. i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! i was surprised by that. awesome.you will feel like tony stark on this device. i added quite a few &#34;skills&#34; like 'thunderstorm sounds' and 'quote of the day' . alexa always loads them up quickly. adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature.i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.i was lucky to buy this for $100 on prime day, but i think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only $100. in my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) taller and 360 sound unit.2) volume knob on top that you spin (i think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) built in hub for hue bulbs. after researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. for me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now.\", 'easy to install. very clear speaker. i took one star off because it was delivered late by ontrac-like usual.', 'love, love, love', '', 'good product.', \"i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this

have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt. i work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the echo and try again. i figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, i can only imagine how

messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me ', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the nd generation is the best i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new one it would be great to have updates to our little a i is i think it

fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your

variety of questions i would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder but i can not complain i also believe it should have an internal power source in order to use the echo it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord it would be nice to use the echo dot on the go without having to buy the other product ', 'love it great fun ', 'love it ', 'outstanding i use all the time works just like they say', 'saving is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less because it has been run through a

freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light alexa would tell me it s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence tried holding the action button for seconds and it didn t do anything

weather is and i love that she works with my amazon fire tv ', 'i like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart tv if i ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if i ask you to change the channel it does or does not sometimes i have to reset it i do not know if it is because it is refurbished but it is okay it is just not what i expected', 'so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not know why it was there asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in but that was not the case took about minutes to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification but on my refurbished echo dot it was green and pulsed ', 'it arrived quickly and was easy to set up it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what i expected alexa and i have become buddies she is a great assistant', 'works as advertised speak clearly and research the commands also get the wall holder it keeps it out

and got this for my bedroom but there s a significant difference in sound the dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it s coming off a cheap portable speaker i was really disappointed i returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo for my bedroom also ', 'took me awhile to get it connected i am not electronically savy but now that it is i love it ', 'cant seem to

highest level ', 'love the echo dot helps husband get netflix and other apps on our amazon fire tv no problems with it being refurbished planning on getting another one for the amazon fire stick in bedroom ', 'stopped working after months the warranty was only good for months i would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for whole months i mean what is this product supposed to be a piece of junk they offered my a discount if i wanted to buy another one why would i want to buy another one ', 'just like new no problems whatsoever alexa thank you ', 'i like my uncle but sometime it goes a little haywire', 'bought this for my son and it didn t work he had to return it ', 'bought and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within months hard and soft reset will not fix the problem ', 'i received my echo dot today in good condition but be advised i paid for it and amazon has as of this writing raised the price to so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal set up with the dot went simple enough plug it in follow the app instructions except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone s wifi settings i called amazon customer service and i dunno what it is but lately i ve been getting terrible support the guy that took my call just rambled off a completely unhelpful script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel i m not sure if this is the norm or if it s because this is refurbished but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my ghz connection is strong reconnecting is a pain each time as well all that said when alexa works she works amazingly well i don t have a speaker hooked up to it but one thing i really enjoy is the mic s range and sensitivity one of the more annoying limitations of apple s siri is that when she s playing audio through device speakers music podcasts etc the hey siri feature is all but useless alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time and with amazingly fast responsiveness too i haven t tried this with louder speakers yet so i m not sure if this will continue to hold true setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze albeit with limitations support for arlo devices is nil and if you have special settings for your led devices eg rainbow effects alexa can t handle them she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels all in all my rating would ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item if the connectivity problems persist i may have to exchange return this item i don t want to though alexa s kind of growing on me ', 'i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs but i have no need for it i only used it once the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill so i rather use my tower speaker which is xs louder ', 'worked like new will do it again ', 'the second one which was a refurbished model did work at least not in my home ', 'very bad this device i don t know if it s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking when you talk you have to yell super lauded', 'good as new just like brand new save yourself some money get one ', 'adding more rooms for convenience', 'nice it works good some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times some time almost screaming ', 'i took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for looks brand new no excuses or disappointments minute trouble free set up effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and could not be happier walk through the door and just ask alexa to play is music and viola instant atmosphere no more opening the ipad going to settings turning on bluetooth and then accessing the pandora app it just makes things so effortless a true joy right out of the box if i did not discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny ', 'alexa is sister my second dot ', 'love my alexa echo dot i have two of them now one new one refurbished both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things i love it as an alarm every morning or whenever i love it to play music or sounds of the ocean or nature sounds when i am trying to sleep

impressed at all does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time i am not sure what the excitement is all about alexas voice sounds like it is under water how am i supposed to understand i am going to return and try a google home ', 'works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished ', 'works great can not tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode i have in my home and will be adding more i love these things ', 'great product but useless overall too many unnecessary features unless you have a smart home you do not need it', 'worked just as good as the two new echo dots i preciously purchases ', 'i bought this for my mother and she is in love with it she loves the guard dog feature she says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house', 'i bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone not working for me read instructions but not working for me ', 'it works', 'bought two of them and both work great i am not much on electronics running my home but alexa does all that i want and need to be done ', ' nd one more to come', 'blue light blinks all the time', 'fun and useful we are still learning new tricks and useful functionalities this is the future of human to computer interface and household automation just like star trek who knew it would be here so soon ', 'works great to control the tv lights and various other devices lately i have been using it when i wake up and do not know what time it is but do not want to open my eyes just shout out alexa what time is it if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it would be golden sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect the echo plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive echo ', 'works great ', 'was not sure if i would like this product but after having it for a little while i want one in every room my daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words we have barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and i am looking forward to learning all of its capabilities ', 'a ', 'great product

with amazon is guarantee thought i would try it glad i did and will probably buy another refurb product form amazon i love the alexa products and have several this one sits on my desk has a small footprint but has great sound and i use it daily works great ', 'not bad bad speaker for sound', 'this is a great device we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list but occasionally use any number of the fun things you can program it to do like go to red alert or make the tardis land yes we are a house of geeks we even chose the wake word to be computer instead of alexa now we just need majel barret is voice and i will be in geek heaven it is not as easy to get my premium spotify to work properly with it and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms but so far it is still been worth it i am often asking it the time the weather it even gives us a news briefing we also use it as an intercom system

google to', 'i loved it it works great', 'extremely low in volume', 'i had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone i ended up using my computer it is interesting that the answers come from wikipedia however i will give echo dot an a in the music playing department i heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations also amusing when alexa responds i do not know that why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing if i had paid full price for this gadget i would have been sorely disappointed now it seems reasonable and a step above hal ', 'brought to replace one that i moved and does not have the same range as my previous non refurbished unit it would seldom be able to find the wi fi and could not connect got tired of hearing the message trouble connecting check the alexa app and just unplugged it i went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times it is just not as strong ', 'if you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the echo dot units simultaneously you must pay a monthly fee i thought this was amazon not apple i ve paid for many of these so i could have one in each

machine it could use a much better speaker ', 'works great and simple to set up alexa is way more accurate than i imagined so im using it more than i thought wish alarms could be set a bit further out

compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base

tooth speaker while playing through a group i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using

messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me ', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the nd generation is the best i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new one it would be great to have updates to our little a i is i think it

fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your

it is smaller but it has never understood commands as easily as our first gen original echo did ', 'worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock however for the price it should come with the stand', 'i love this device all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen it looks great on my nightstand as a clock lots of faces to choose from and displays weather reminders etc i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway it s a great shape and doesn t take up a lot of room i m planning to get another one for my guest room awesome for a great price ', 'i love the echo spot this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to alexa like the other devices in my home i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion i named him echo now if i could only choose a male voice i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell so many more features don t forget to buy thestand base so many advantages to having that read the reviews highly recommend ', 'i love this little spot more than i thought i would the sound is great for such a little thing my music plays nice and loud and clear the video is terrific i was watching some prime shows just for the heck of it and i was really impressed immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday only thing that kept me from giving it stars i really wish it was cordless i love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain and it won t connect to my bluetooth speaker while playing amazon prime music for some reason which is a drag when i want to hear it in the dining room during dinner of course if it was cordless i could just bring it with me otherwise i absolutely love it and will probably buy another one ', 'i bought on prime day and so glad i did it s easy to use and lots of customization options i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read but i disagree ', 'honestly i like it but at the same time i don t i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it', 'overall it is great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and date however sometimes it freezes and does not respond properly no error message about lack of connectivity it just stops resetting resolves the problem ', 'i love all that you can do with the echo spot ', 'the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo easy to use', 'love it perfect for an alarm clock replacement plus so much more ', 'i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom ', 'we absolutely love this product wish we would have bought this instead of the dots ', 'we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly you can even hear music played the speaker is clear we are enjoying it what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me the next day i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before it was a little disconcerting ', 'i like echo spot i bought it to use as an alarm clock one negative that i didnt really think about when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better', 'this is our second echo spot to go with out two echo dots love the look and how alexia responds ', 'love my echo spot ', 'it is very slow compared to the echo', 'i love the way it is designed and you have choices for the face i use it for my bed side i drop in on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling ', 'terrific sound for a small device and nice form factor for the nightstand i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa not using video much but it would be nice if the device had a square rectangular screen ', 'new to alexa like this spot a lot ', 'it is not perfect but i really like this little gizmo i bought it primarily for purposes first so i could set wake up alarms by individual days and set the wake up music individually by the day second i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep without having to get out of bed to turn a switch the echo spot together with a smart plug has been able to accomplish that a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlists what is not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating hopefully the ai gets better in the future along with added functions ', 'i love it it is so easy to use', 'put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm works great every morning i get the weather and news when i get up also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and i have ', 'love it', 'part of it is my fault i thought it could be wireless though for the price i still feel like it should be also the sound quality and volume could be better i prefer the tap unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones computers or ipads just not worth it ', 'very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone ', 'i love my new echo spot ', 'i love this clock i just have to tell it to set my alarm no more fussing with buttons ', 'could not be more pleased amazon hit this one out of the park looks great and runs great love it ', 'responds easily and like the ability to do at night ', 'easy setup love it ', 'simply amazing what a awsome device it never ceases to amaze me wake up to big bang music go to sleep softly falling rain drop in on the kids and keep in touch i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do ', 'i was skeptical at first but it grows on you it looks good so far i did however turn off the camera ', 'sound quality is disappointing ', 'i love it i especially love that it is so small and does so much got rid of my old cd alarm clock radio much more room on nightstand ', 'great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off', 'the ease to use product', 'so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clock radio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good ', 'i am just entering the smart technology world i have not figured it all out yet but so far it is pretty cool ', 'it was smaller than i had anticipated and when i say that i very much mean it however it still works very well quality sound easily programmed easy to work with but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs ', '', 'love my echo spot ', 'great deal great product ', 'perfect', 'i had a couple of echo dots previously bought these specifically for the ring doorbell video cloud cam display interface capabilities was not disappointed love the fact that i can ask to see front yard back yard front door etc the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool bonus alexa show me ant man trailer etc i know this can all be done on laptop desktop but it s cool now having an appliance that s always just there and it doesn t interrupt what i m doing ', 'bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room love them both the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design shows lyrics photos etc i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps alexa turn off lights love it ', 'love that is can do so much it sits on my nightstand only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger but overall i m happy i have it would recommend ', 'it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it ', 'cool little piece of tech we re still learning some of its functions and possibilities but i can see some potential even my technically challenged wife already figured out how to video call our daughter ', 'i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device alarm wake up music weather top news stories etc perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echos in the future ', 'as an alexa device it works just as well as any of the other products unfortunately it does not go up from there the ability to play videos is very limited you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock faces and you can control what is displays with one glaring and very annoying exception you can not turn off the things to try screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen i do not need to be reminded every seconds what things i can do with alexa i do not need the advertising especially at the cost of this device overall its an expensive alexa device with a screen that is not very useful and annoying i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that is actually useful ', 'so far so good ', 'this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room its the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all overall a great addition to my smart home its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn on off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone i have a bunch of other alexa devices but this was the first one with a screen ', 'i love this thing i talk to it through walls and in other rooms i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited kindle unlimited prime video etc so i was ready for this when it came out the screen is just so nice to have the only thing resembling a down side is that it does not always perfectly understand which song i want to hear but i do have a deep southern accent lower alabama so i do not speak english anyways ', 'smaller than i thought it would be happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table ', 'echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready unfortunately that is not case perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated ', 'nice', 'i like it', '', 'we have owned a number of echo devices but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool other than playing music through a sound system we have not found much use for them we just do not find the voice user interface to be all that efficient the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you are routinely interested in furthermore you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings we now use these as bedside clocks ', 'i love my echo spot waking to my favorite music being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark all the skills i have yet to try easy to use ', 'i like how small it is but i m still able to see my ring cameras ', 'great for checking in on my son after school when i am still at work love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so i can plan my route accordingly', 'love it super fun easy to use my three year old even gets involved', 'i returnef this item because it does not speak spanish', '', 'i am a hardcore fan of echo infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family i have echo echo dot echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot every variant has its own beauty i love feel and size of echo spot it s fabulous as far as looks are concerned it does not have great audio quality which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch ', 'love this ', 'i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up ', 'works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa does not work as well as the normal echo sometimes alexa does not hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions the speaker also is not as good as the normal echo screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who is at the front door but it is great for the bedside ', 'fun tech toy', 'love it small with good sound', 'with the combination of this smart plugins and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it i can order stuff get answers watch videos get weather set alarms video call and so much more with this device ', 'great product', 'in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house extrimelly useful hub of information music automation communication and assistant in basic needs would love to have a voice personalization some things are better not to said aloud but typed like door unlocking codes but that is problem of unwitty developers so far only positive experience the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off ', 'i love this device it is so great what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker only reason i did not give stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos and google play music the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it is dark in the room other than those minor things i love it great buy and would buy again', 'hands free control', 'great love the display and easy to use though still learning what all it can do everyday ', 'it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start even from a distance a lot of the skills are excellent i have added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it is ridiculous that it can not access youtube it might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event i imagine this is a functionality people would use often ', 'setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock', 'great product highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it it sits much better on the desk ', 'eh it s cool and all but also kinda boring i don t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so is about right i can t connect to my spotify unless it s premium and i m in college and i m not paying or that or amazon music so', 'i am huge amazon fan first to have a kindle and the echo i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile i do love it my kids love it they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i can t it s spot to spot can t even skype which i do often with my aunt the is my major disappointment with it ', 'love love love these the only think i notice is that it does not pick up my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots we have echo products throughout our house i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock i am no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists ', 'love my amazon products', 'love this', 'love my spot have that a dot and a regular echo', 'nice upgrade from an echo dot ', 'works decent wish it was able to answer more questions need a better source for info but the rest works great ', 'i can not live without alexa ', 'really like it the screen is a major plus ', 'didnt think id get an alexa device but this is perfect for my home office the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other alexa devices it can show lyrics of songs play my xm radio can show videos of movie trailers and news its great ', 'i love it i made a group with my echo dot so i get music through my home i am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully i can get another spot for my bedroom i love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice ', 'when we first received this product it was great however about a week ago the device served up a video advertisement around pm at night and scared myself and my family if you want to make sure you are protected and do not allow video directly in your home the spot is not a device that can keep you safe ', 'it is fun to use and makes my life easier in some sense ', 'love it ', '', '', 'i got my echo spot on prime day and love it i think it still is a little expensive but the chance to save convinced me to buy it i basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly i also like the sleep sounds skill and hearing the weather i am still exploring the other skills just discovered some star trek sounds alexa beam me up which are fun ', 'love this replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this love that it dims at night very responsive to commands ', 'love my spot she even more than i expected great size for a bedroom ', 'so far so good just got it and i am trying to figure out all the things it can do the product itself is very well made and easy to set up ', 'after only a couple of days alexa did not answer i have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting ', 'perfect may favorite alexa device by far specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam is it does the job really well we changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive good job amazon ', 'is great use it for music mostly ', 'it won t receive calls and it s really hard to call someone who has another echo ', 'this is our first step into a smart home soon as i added one item to the grocery list i started loving it my wife was so so about it til i opened rain sounds she s a convert love

dimat night so it s not bright for sleeping ', 'love this product i use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options the only thing i would like to see them add on to it is the

alexa device does it is quite loud for its size as well sound way better than echo dot it also does video calling which is pretty awesome the viewing angle is great so even if its sitting fairly high up you can still see the display well enough ', 'quick and easy to set up', 'i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement the display brightness dims too much at night

clean clock i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep my two year old sleeps so much better with it on we also use it to tell my two year old stories

me each morning and plays music when i ask ', 'this product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable there is a card on the homescreen called things to try it is an ad for other alexa services you can try you can turn off all the other homescreen cards but not this one by default the homescreen cards cycle automatically which is incredibly annoying there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only cycle once instead of cycle continuously but critically this setting does not work my unit has been set to cycle once and the cards still continue to cycle all the time have rebooted the device re set etc etc until these two obvious software issues are fixed in my opinion the product is useless ', 'great deal on prime day', 'no problem', 'excelente

present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking cutting cleaning etc especially when our counters aren t very wide to begin with after

movie i d been dying to see on this it s a great way to listen to music watch a quick youtube video etc i even attempted watching jaws on this and while it wasn t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do it wasn t as bad as one would think i would definitely recommend ', 'we love the echo spot i use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iheartradio radio while getting dressed ', 'it

usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like yes you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still have not adding this setting clearly not going to happen

grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools note i did purchase camera covers even though there is a

night stand she reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views ', '', 'i got this on prime day and figured i would see what all the hype is about honestly i did not really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird but honestly i love it like it or not this is the way the world is going so why not i loved it so much i ordered i did not get the show because it looks like it came from the is and is downright ugly i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway so the spot is screen does not bother me although it is very clear alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it is hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar where i can just say play any song i want and it will i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you do not know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much they also do not rotate when playing music i would love for it to display the weather as i listen to music the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to different places that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic i have this programmed for my parents fiances parents work and her work so it really works great the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot the dot lights up colors why can not the spot the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery overall it is a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around i am already looking at dash buttons smart plugs etc and when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can not tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration ', 'the screen response time is way better than i expected sound quality is good too also it s not so

for what it is two issues one minor and one major the minor one why include the huge bezel on the front why not take that space and make the display larger a total waste of usable space the major one also involves the show i am very used to these devices i do not need to see things to try whenever i use a voice command with it even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices i am not a child and i do not need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed why does not amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off i want to see a clock face period not these silly nanny reminders ',

great for what i use it for an alarm clock a weather station background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house my biggest gripe about the device and why i knocked a star off is that you can not turn off the suggestions on things to try it is an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you do not want to see as it cycles through content screens a software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and do not want to see in the content rotation ', 'can not turn of things to try on the screen

instructions told to wait longer really unacceptable expected more from amazon find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance ',

before bed the screen is too small to watch shows it displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures my only complaint is that they do not add the stand as standard i did not need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed many people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i am not going to split hairs the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice i think amazon is working overtime on this project i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything i am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i am staying in a hotel and she is no where to be found alexa what time is it alexa ', 'when we were buying another product there was an option to

use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video much of the time it works well as alarm clock but there are some serious flaws particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake it doesn t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with people on different schedules try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying alexa set an alarm for am and then having alexa repeat ok alarm set for am not good i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid plain and simple this device needs to be brought into the s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone no thanks if i m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i m in the shower ', 'i bought this for my mother and she loves it i want to get one for myself now ', '', 'invasive and scared the crap

sound the video screen is sharp sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a command but as i get to know the system better i m hoping that will improve one drawback in the music i ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past are re recordings by the original artist but not the original recording itself example secret agent man by johnny rivers a live version is used not the original version if i m going to pay for prime music i d like to hear the original version of songs not later recordings or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear otherwise i am very pleased

would never reccomend it even for the i spent i feel like i got shorted oh and lastly the device is pretty useless without a prime membership i linked my personal account to it and the thing was

extra a month leaving this item a subscription nightmare and a overpriced decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes i would give it zero stars if i could ', 'quite nice clear great sound ', 'versatile

purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he would not feel left out and isolated they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so

have it ignored i am learning workarounds but they are mediocre at best and as yet do not include a personal playlist i have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more

echo plus to control it i chose a kwikset because amazon said it was compatible and i bought dots while i was at it and when i posed the question somebody in the community said it will work with alexa what i did not know was the z wave lock and zigbee alexa hub were not compatible does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus if not i guess my choices are exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink return the whole alexa system and get something else i do not want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or i will be back here asking how to integrate two hubs the reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point is because i was afraid they would not operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something does not work ', 'this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life ', 'i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub i am in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home for the same price as some hub is and even less expensive in some other cases i got a hub that works with my devices plus it does a lot more i have not even had time to go through all the skills it has but i have already found myself using many of them when i started a search for a hub i was not even considering the echo in part because i did not know it was a hub but also because i did not really think i would find much use for another ai system if you are looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost is the same or less than other hubs oh and by the way for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb saw another that came with a smart plug given the price of these extras well that just put the echo plus over the top ', 'i am so happy that i purchased alexa when i recently saw this at a friend is home he played some music while talking about the product i love the sound love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question she responds immediately i have not been able to listen to my cd is for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it is not an issue any longer ', 'after we learned to use this we are still learning we are very pleased

can play my music from amazon music pandora tunein i heart radio and spotify echo can even play my local radio station i love that the echo is connected to my tivo bolt this allows tivo to pause stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered the only three dislikes that i have is that if you re up too close or to far the echo doesn t respond so i think they need to improve the microphone and i wish the speaker was better the speakers are okay but could be improved also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet well the other day i received a red light right on my echo plus this error was sorry i m having trouble understanding you please try again later after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my internet and it was easy to find this out

wanted alexa to control and they all work great i already had an echo dot in my kitchen den area so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tp link plugs but the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus i am able to play music set my alarm get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices the echo dot requires a tp link plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not

nice and well integrated smart home love it ', 'i have not had it very long but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions ', 'although this is my second echo device i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation instructions as to the many functions of the device i purchased becausse of the sound quality but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device or at least point out where it can be found ', 'the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in

reason i bought it was for youtube and apparently youtube stopped supporting it and that is why it will get stars it is mostly youtube is fault but i worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue

i m not around no spanish ', 'love all the cool thing i can do ', 'great product', 'like it still working discovery really too soon to fully evaluate but looking forward to learning and using it ', 'when i got this echo i was excited to have a device with better sound than my dot and a hub to control some hue bulbs what i did not realize and also was not fully communicated to me is that you can not use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices if you do you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless i still love the echo and have zero complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device i am only disappointed with the hub is functionalities

story to my children they love it and that makes me happy ', 'excellent why didn t i think it is in the beginning i love it', 'bye bye philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge took a little tinkering had to rest the individual bulbs but works great no more philips hue bridge is not responding message ', 'works great exactly as described only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff ', 'i love it use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from', 'very easy to hook up download the app and it walks you through the setup', 'i am so disappointed in this product i tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed hours with amazon technicians resetting each of them the app did not connect the echo plus to the internet connection tried using the application on a phone a tablet

well with smart home devices', 'use way more often than we used our google home ', 'mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result ', 'nice add on to a home what i do not like are the limitations for example world soccer it will not give you much info of sport teams other than american ', 'i was a little apprehensive about buying this because i saw reviews saying it sounds like crap i am no audiophile by any means so maybe it is that but i think it sounds great considering the size it fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear i have not had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands i have it paired to an ecobee my firestick and a phillip is hue light bulb i plan on adding devices as i go i love this thing and i am glad i scooped it up i have only had it around weeks will update if i run into issues ', 'i love my echo plus the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient to use outdoors ', 'great device my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me ', 'the

through the door she purchases re orders off of amazon for my pets and i heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to regardless if she was unplugged or not this is important

nothing but annoying the hub can not be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge i can not even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues bottom line is it sucks as a hub it does not support z wave and zigbee which in fairness i knew in advance but when the one protocol it does support does not do many functions that a dedicated one will what is the point i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this does not i found

well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off thank god no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights thank you amazon i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirm com to purchase more of each and some

hue light bulb would be a great start alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning verbalize books playing music on command even linked to my sirrius xm account good daily stuff good sound but not bose but the ads say hub included so do not need anything else to operate devices well not so i understand there will be some differences in product device support the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on off dimming of the bulb the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge so it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes time the lights when you are away set color tones etc that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge was very disappointed to find that out after the fact to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs ', '', 'i love it but does not play well with my amazon prime many shortcomings and potential fees', 'item as described and delivered on time thank you', 'i bought of these plus echo dot nd generation on prime days love the echo plus easy to setup the reason for the

went orange i googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions i tried both product is defective', 'exactly what i wanted with speedy shipping thank you so much ', 'easy to

louder than all combined at the same time very impressed with the clarity and volume you will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio that s just a sad fact it ll play pandora and spotify but it s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple users will be disappointed to see that it s not as convenient as an apple deviceoverall i still loved the device but i ll be getting the dot which has an audio out jack as does the echo plus and just connect to external speakers', 'i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb the excited ended quickly i spend about a total of hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus everything i tried ended in a discovery failed message i tried to set this up over and over and over again i watched youtube videos i read set up websites i was the poster child of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work but also the problem not being operator error well after tech support staff and hr and mins of being on the phone it still did not work this product has tested my patience so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school the only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb the problem was not the bulb because before packing up the items i purchased another bulb and still alexa could not locate this device i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo the support person had the same thought maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can not get over the look of that hub it looks like a defuser i can not believe i did not find youtube videos that show the problems i did everything looked simple and seamless not the experience i had ok i am done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend

when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i have always loved it i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus let me tell you what great choice as much as i love my original echo the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable the sound is great and the fact that it is got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus ', 'received the wrong product was so excited to install it all excitement gone thank you amazon ', 'i m having trouble with it the alarm most of times doesn t work the timer doesn t ends and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable ', 'love it just wish i could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription', 'sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs ', 'i got it to try side by side with the echo originale they are essentially the same in dimension weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub as many folks already pointed out the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue z wave or anything else it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub for me the voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i do not really need the hub with less functionality in addition i do not think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs net net for me this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good with the original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these ', 'why do we need to buy a hub to get it to work with samsung tv is and many other devices i want my money back this thing will not even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub what is the point of having a hub that does not support half the devices out there do not buy this thing unless you want to spend another on another hub it will not work with many of your devices just by the echo or dot if you must but not this better yet get a google device they actually understand you when you talk ', 'i love it in my living room', 'absolutely love it only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable when playing music with bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs ', 'i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb when i got everything set up i realized the echo plus hub won t allow full functionality of the bulb all it does is turn the light on off and dim it will not change colors you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb i wish i d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights ', 'at a volume setting of half or less the speaker sounds like there is something rattling crackling or vibrating in it i would understand if the volume was set higher all speakers get distorted when over driven but this does not sound like this is an over driven case sounds like more of a rattle crackle possibly because the bass is too high learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics other than volume i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem ', 'the sound is fantastic for the classic music is like you have the orchestra at your home and you can control the sound with out screamig at it

to give so many free bulbs away disappointed i have yet to set up my echo our first purchase on any alexia device debating if we want to keep it it did come quickly with my prime membership ', 'i

happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day as well as sang him happy birthday lolol he now has educated him self on things he never knew and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked love it and to think i was going to hate it ', 'incredible piece of technology i have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and sound more appealing it is no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons on the echo a large inconvenience and not as precise for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo nd generation the piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over this order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought i put the bulbs into my living room floor lamp turned on the light and all i had to do was say alexa connect my devices the default names for each bulb was assigned as first light and second light so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on off one of the lights by saying alexa turn off the second light in the alexa app i created a group with first light and second light and named the group the light so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say alexa turn on the light i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb i was surprised by that awesome you will feel like tony stark on this device i added quite a few skills like nothunderstorm sounds and quote of the day alexa always loads them up quickly adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership i was lucky to buy this for on prime day but i think for is it pretty expensive considering the echo is only in my opinion you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you taller and sound unit volume knob on top that you spin i think this is a huge benefit over buttons built in hub for hue bulbs after researching more there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups for me and my floor lamp it is just perfect i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now ', 'easy to install very clear speaker i took one star off because it was delivered late by ontrac like usual ', 'love love love', '', 'good product ', 'i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck or the color or the shape or even the way it smells but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up x is now to no avail i have other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly i have reset my phone galaxy s checked the app for updates i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt i work in the network technology industry for a living and have for over years now so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up the set up screen just continues to roll the dots around the screen for about minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close restart my phone and the echo and try again i figured x is was enough it should not be that hard a techie i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology i hope they will not call me i will tell em to send the product back ', 'pretty cool device still have a lot to learn but i am changing channels on my fios and getting info needed the

to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price which right now is a total of a month amazon fire stick is limited to gb of memory and gb of storage thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows so far it has not been any issue at all the upcoming fall tv schedule which includes the return of nfl football might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often i will worry about that then my only real issue is that you can not really turn it off the screen remains on and uses up electricity although probably small amounts luckily when you unplug it all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it is unplugged have not tried it yet although i do not

fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it is little rough patch and i have not had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then

to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use customer service could not help they basically told me to contact sprint

money and buy the nicer one that is actually alexa ', 'i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with it such as set a timer a reminder play music and games i do not like that

connect your tv etc to the commands from alexa but i really love having the music ', 'i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account i think it should be part of the top line with video music etc i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names which i can never remember i like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries ',

the time my fault for not checking this but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery if i could return it i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa ', 'i do not think the nd gen sounds as good as the st but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker but if you are going to do that why would not you just get a dot nd issue is which is not unique to this unit but i do not understand why i can not override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a group i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker ', 'everything', 'i like the interaction of asking questions i don t like that i can t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp ', 'supberb sound definitely worth the

first request i do not consider it an upgrade ', 'i have had all good experience so far with the second generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now

'the echo is an amazing device many times it seems very intuitive but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me ', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the nd generation is the best i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new one it would be great to have updates to our little a i is i think it

fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since

features we mainly use our echos for the standard stuff playing music setting alarms answering questions etc it is not the life changing home device amazon would have you believe but it is convenient

you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if i ask you to change the channel it does or does not sometimes i have to reset it i do not know if it is because it is refurbished but it is okay it is just not what i expected', 'so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not know why it was there asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in but that was not the case took about minutes to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification but on my refurbished echo dot it was green and pulsed ', 'it arrived quickly and was easy to set up it was a refurbished amazon echo dot

it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo for my bedroom also ', 'took me awhile to get it connected i am not electronically savy but now that it is i love it ', 'cant seem to

problems whatsoever alexa thank you ', 'i like my uncle but sometime it goes a little haywire', 'bought this for my son and it didn t work he had to return it ', 'bought and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within months hard and soft reset will not fix the problem ', 'i received my echo dot today in good condition but be advised i paid for it and amazon has as of this writing raised the price to so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal set up with the dot went simple enough plug it in follow the app instructions except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone s wifi settings i called amazon customer service and i dunno what it is but lately i ve been getting terrible support the guy that took my call just rambled off a completely unhelpful script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel i m not sure if this is the norm or if it s because this is refurbished but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my ghz connection is strong reconnecting is a pain each time as well all that said when alexa works she works amazingly well i don t have a speaker hooked up to it but one thing i really enjoy is the mic s range and sensitivity one of the more annoying limitations of apple s siri is that when she s playing audio through device speakers music podcasts etc the hey siri feature is all but useless alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time and with amazingly fast responsiveness too i haven t tried this with louder speakers yet so i m not sure if this will continue to hold true setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze albeit with limitations support for arlo devices is nil and if you have special settings for your led devices eg rainbow effects alexa can t handle them she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels all in all my rating would ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item if the connectivity problems persist i may have to exchange return this item i don t want to though alexa s kind of growing on me ', 'i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs but i have no need for it i only used it once the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill so i rather use my tower speaker which is xs louder ', 'worked like new will do it again ', 'the second one which was a refurbished model did work at least not in my home ', 'very bad this

new just like brand new save yourself some money get one ', 'adding more rooms for convenience', 'nice it works good some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times some time almost screaming ', 'i took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for looks brand new no excuses or disappointments minute trouble free set up effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and could not be happier walk through the door and just ask alexa to play is music and viola instant atmosphere no more opening the ipad going to settings turning on bluetooth and then accessing the pandora app it just makes things so effortless a true joy right out of the box if i did not discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny ', 'alexa is sister my second dot ', 'love my alexa echo dot i have two of them now one new one refurbished both

footprint but has great sound and i use it daily works great ', 'not bad bad speaker for sound', 'this is a great device we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list but occasionally use any number of the fun things you can program it to do like go to red alert or make the tardis land yes we are a house of geeks we even chose the wake word to be computer instead of alexa now we just need majel barret is voice and i will be in geek heaven it is not as easy to get my premium spotify to work properly with it and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so

above hal ', 'brought to replace one that i moved and does not have the same range as my previous non refurbished unit it would seldom be able to find the wi fi and could not connect got tired of

a brand new echo dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good it was quite different from my expectations refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while i realized that the power adapter was faulty there is no way for me to have amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options i love amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was

as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa ', 'i do not think the nd gen sounds as good as the st but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker but if you are going to do that why would not you just get a dot nd issue is which is not unique to this unit but i do not understand why i can not override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a group i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker ', 'everything', 'i like the interaction of asking questions i don t like that i can t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp ', 'supberb sound definitely worth the

ability example for our smart lights in the house unless we specify kitchen light or kitchen light prior to the command she either won t respond or says she doesn t recognize it may be me but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she won t respond to me but will my husband i know it sounds odd we laugh about it but maybe it

has one works great did not come in packaging but it was sealed up and had no damage and was not missing anything i like the sound quality i see some knock it it is not a bose but it is more than great for our family easy to use minor learning curve as it learns your voice it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services can not wait to get for my classroom too it is a lot of fun even

not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she would not play anything she is not smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can not use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged her not sure i will ever use my alexa again ', 'i like everything about it ', 'liked ', 'never had any issue with buying use electronics as long

first request i do not consider it an upgrade ', 'i have had all good experience so far with the second generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now

all anymore i am too busy listening to music speaker is pretty goo for its size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family ', 'enjoyed entire echo experience', 'easy to set up ', 'the echo is an amazing device many times it seems very intuitive but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me ', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the nd generation is the best i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new one it would be great to have updates to our little a i is i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you', 'very pleased with the echo nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we haven t discovered ', 'i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely handy ', 'easy to setup love all the things she does ', 'have alexa throughout the house the future has arrived ', 'i already have an alexa and with amazon find today i could not resist getting an echo also it is the best thing i ever did i use them on each side of the house and could not be happier ', 'arrived as expected ', 'bought this a few weeks ago everything about this product is excellent do not forget to buy a charger when ordering it is a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard ', 'terrific', 'love my echo', 'it s smaller than the original looks nicer too ', 'works great ', 'my husband and i are what i would call late adopters when it come to technology but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source wow were we amazed and the great sound we have also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs

it ', 'we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there i personally love the timer feature it has helped me with

figure out how it works ', 'this was given to my year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad he loves it ask alexa anything she has the answer plus it s good for homework so i purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when i m getting ready for work i listen to music at am and the base it s metro booming replacement for my clock radio plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock ', 'very impressed with look clarity of sound and color ', 'alexa is amazing great speaker ', 'still getting used to alexa do not have her connected to our tv yet or other things right now

functionality still to discover ', 'i have had pure fun with my echo weather jokes news briefing and music but still so much more to use it for a lot of fun for the money ', 'use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home', 'love it still learning makes a lot of things easier like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off ', 'bought this for my daughter when she turned she loves it i especially like the calling feature since she doesn t have a cell phone she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs sometimes over and over and over again lol ', 'we got this as a wedding gift and haven t discovered all of its features yet will update playing music is great though ', 'i am impressed with the sound quality ', 'very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker love the fact that i can play music of different genre is whenever i want had

use this as a speaker to stream music we ve had it months and it s just kinda useless ', 'once set up very user friendly set up was not as user friendly as i would hoped the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing invasive drivers my wife and i are both retired and she would not have been able to install alexa but if my son was not supplying her with a smart phone we would not be using alexa yet ', 'very easy set up really enjoying it', 'the echo doesn t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it makes it quite inconvenient ', 'more compact and a bit better than the original', 'i love it pretty cool ', 'i having it in my living room music sounds really good in my living room i can hear it upstairs ', 'this is a great product set

great ', 'from such a small speaker it sounds great', 'great sound for the size and the prize and of course alexa ', 'if you do not have an echo you definitely need one', 'great device seems to work

capabilities very fun to learn how to use it ', 'i used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos', 'don t use it for much as i thought we would synced with kasa cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot lyrics for music is cool too other than that it s used as a clock and standard dot ish features ', 'amazing so far just got it the other day ', 'i like that it is smaller but it has never understood commands as easily as our first gen original echo did ', 'worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock however for the price it should come with the stand', 'i love this device all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen it looks great on my nightstand as a clock lots of faces to choose from and displays weather reminders etc i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway it s a great shape and doesn t take up a lot of room i m planning to get another one for my guest room awesome for a great price ', 'i love the echo spot this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to alexa like the other devices in my home i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion i named him echo now if i could only choose a male voice i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell so many more features don t forget to buy thestand base so many advantages to having that read the reviews highly recommend ', 'i love this little spot more than i thought i would the sound is great for such a little thing my music plays nice and loud and clear the video is terrific i was watching some prime shows just for the heck of it and i was really impressed immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday only thing that kept me from giving it stars i really wish it was cordless i love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain and it won t connect to my bluetooth speaker while playing amazon prime music for some reason which is a drag when i want to hear it in the dining room during dinner of course if it was cordless i could just bring it with me otherwise i absolutely love it and will probably buy another one ', 'i bought on prime day and so glad i did it s easy to use and lots of customization options i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read but i disagree ', 'honestly i like it but at the same time i don t i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it', 'overall it is great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and date however sometimes it freezes and does not respond properly no error message about lack of connectivity it just stops resetting resolves the problem ', 'i love all that you can do with the echo spot ', 'the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo easy to use', 'love it perfect for an alarm clock replacement plus so much more ', 'i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom ', 'we absolutely love this product wish we would have bought this instead of the dots ', 'we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly you can even hear music played the speaker is clear we are enjoying it what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me the next day i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before it was a little disconcerting ', 'i like echo spot i bought it to use as an alarm clock one negative that i didnt really think about when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better', 'this is our second echo spot to go with out two echo dots love the look and how alexia responds ', 'love my echo spot ', 'it is very slow compared to the echo', 'i love the way it is designed and you have choices for the face i use it for my bed side i drop in on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling ', 'terrific sound for a small device and nice form factor for the nightstand i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa not using video much but it would be nice if the device had a square rectangular screen ', 'new to alexa like this spot a lot ', 'it is not perfect but i really like this little gizmo i bought it primarily for purposes first so i could set wake up alarms by individual days and set the wake up music individually by the day second i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep without having to get out of bed to turn a switch the echo spot together with a smart plug has been able to accomplish that a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlists what is not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating hopefully the ai gets better in the future along with added functions ', 'i love it it is so easy to use', 'put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm works great every morning i get the weather and news when i get up also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and i have ', 'love it', 'part of it is my fault i thought it could be wireless though for the price i still feel like it should be also the sound quality and volume could be better i prefer the tap unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones computers or ipads just not worth it ', 'very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone ', 'i love my new echo spot ', 'i love this clock i just have to tell it to set my alarm no more fussing with buttons ', 'could not be more pleased amazon hit this one out of the park looks great and runs great love it ', 'responds easily and like the ability to do at night ', 'easy setup love it ', 'simply amazing what a awsome device it never ceases to amaze me wake up to big bang music go to sleep softly falling rain drop in on the kids and keep in touch i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do ', 'i was skeptical at first but it grows on you it looks good so far i did however turn off the camera ', 'sound quality is disappointing ', 'i love it i especially love that it is so small and does so much got rid of my old cd alarm clock radio much more room on nightstand ', 'great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off', 'the ease to use product', 'so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clock radio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good ', 'i am just entering the smart technology world i have not figured it all out yet but so far it is pretty cool ', 'it was smaller than i had anticipated and when i say that i very much mean it however it still works very well quality sound easily programmed easy to work with but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs ', '', 'love my echo spot ', 'great deal great product ', 'perfect', 'i had a couple of echo dots previously bought these specifically for the ring doorbell video cloud cam display interface capabilities was not disappointed love the fact that i can ask to see front yard back yard front door etc the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool bonus alexa show me ant man trailer etc i know this can all be done on laptop desktop but it s cool now having an appliance that s always just there and it doesn t interrupt what i m doing ', 'bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room love them both the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design shows lyrics photos etc i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps alexa turn off lights love it ', 'love that is can do so much it sits on my nightstand only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger but overall i m happy i have it would recommend ', 'it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it ', 'cool little piece of tech we re still learning some of its functions and possibilities but i can see some potential even my technically challenged wife already figured out how to video call our daughter ', 'i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device alarm wake up music weather top news stories etc perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echos in the future ', 'as an alexa device it works just as well as any of the other products unfortunately it does not go up from there the ability to play videos is very limited you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock faces and you can control what is displays with one glaring and very annoying exception you can not turn off the things to try screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen i do not need to be reminded every seconds what things i can do with alexa i do not need the advertising especially at the cost of this device overall its an expensive alexa device with a screen that is not very useful and annoying i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that is actually useful ', 'so far so good ', 'this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room its the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all overall a great addition to my smart home its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn on off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone i have a bunch of other alexa devices but this was the first one with a screen ', 'i love this thing i talk to it through walls and in other rooms i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited kindle unlimited prime video etc so i was ready for this when it came out the screen is just so nice to have the only thing resembling a down side is that it does not always perfectly understand which song i want to hear but i do have a deep southern accent lower alabama so i do not speak english anyways ', 'smaller than i thought it would be happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table ', 'echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready unfortunately that is not case perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated ', 'nice', 'i like it', '', 'we have owned a number of echo devices but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool other than playing music through a sound system we have not found much use for them we just do not find the voice user interface to be all that efficient the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you are routinely interested in furthermore you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings we now use these as bedside clocks ', 'i love my echo spot waking to my favorite music being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark all the skills i have yet to try easy to use ', 'i like how small it is but i m still able to see my ring cameras ', 'great for checking in on my son after school when i am still at work love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so i can plan my route accordingly', 'love it super fun easy to use my three year old even gets involved', 'i returnef this item because it does not speak spanish', '', 'i am a hardcore fan of echo infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family i have echo echo dot echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot every variant has its own beauty i love feel and size of echo spot it s fabulous as far as looks are concerned it does not have great audio quality which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch ', 'love this ', 'i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up ', 'works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa does not work as well as the normal echo sometimes alexa does not hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions the speaker also is not as good as the normal echo screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who is at the front door but it is great for the bedside ', 'fun tech toy', 'love it small with good sound', 'with the combination of this smart plugins and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it i can order stuff get answers watch videos get weather set alarms video call and so much more with this device ', 'great product', 'in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house extrimelly useful hub of information music automation communication and assistant in basic needs would love to have a voice personalization some things are better not to said aloud but typed like door unlocking codes but that is problem of unwitty developers so far only positive experience the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off ', 'i love this device it is so great what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker only reason i did not give stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos and google play music the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it is dark in the room other than those minor things i love it great buy and would buy again', 'hands free control', 'great love the display and easy to use though still learning what all it can do everyday ', 'it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start even from a distance a lot of the skills are excellent i have added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it is ridiculous that it can not access youtube it might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event i imagine this is a functionality people would use often ', 'setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock', 'great product highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it it sits much better on the desk ', 'eh it s cool and all but also kinda boring i don t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so is about right i can t connect to my spotify unless it s premium and i m in college and i m not paying or that or amazon music so', 'i am huge amazon fan first to have a kindle and the echo i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile i do love it my kids love it they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i can t it s spot to spot can t even skype which i do often with my aunt the is my major disappointment with it ', 'love love love these the only think i notice is that it does not pick up my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots we have echo products throughout our house i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock i am no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists ', 'love my amazon products', 'love this', 'love my spot have that a dot and a regular echo', 'nice upgrade from an echo dot ', 'works decent wish it was able to answer more questions need a better source for info but the rest works great ', 'i can not live without alexa ', 'really like it the screen is a major plus ', 'didnt think id get an alexa device but this is perfect for my home office the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other alexa devices it can show lyrics of songs play my xm radio can show videos of movie trailers and news its great ', 'i love it i made a group with my echo dot so i get music through my home i am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully i can get another spot for my bedroom i love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice ', 'when we first received this product it was great however about a week ago the device served up a video advertisement around pm at night and scared myself and my family if you want to make sure you are protected and do not allow video directly in your home the spot is not a device that can keep you safe ', 'it is fun to use and makes my life easier in some sense ', 'love it ', '', '', 'i got my echo spot on prime day and love it i think it still is a little expensive but the chance to save convinced me to buy it i basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly i also like the sleep sounds skill and hearing the weather i am still exploring the other skills just discovered some star trek sounds alexa beam me up which are fun ',

dimat night so it s not bright for sleeping ', 'love this product i use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options the only thing i would like to see them add on to it is the

get an alarm clock this is the one to get yes its much more than that it shows you the time it shows you the weather its touch screen it shows you music lyrics and it does all the things your typical alexa device does it is quite loud for its size as well sound way better than echo dot it also does video calling which is pretty awesome the viewing angle is great so even if its sitting fairly high up you can still see the display well enough ', 'quick and easy to set up', 'i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement the display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task the display works well for camera viewing it is an attractive device and a decent value at ', 'great device', 'i m a fan of echo devices i think it s a great alternative to a clean clock i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep my two year old sleeps so much better with it on we also use it to tell my two year old stories

addicted this little number is awesome not only do i like that it displays the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other echo devices one feature i really like is how it

anything i like the jokes it tells i m still learning different functions', 'meh', 'best looking echo device easy to use', 'a helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but amazon will likely fix and improve it ', 'we like it very convenient', 'i love the size of the echo spot it fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show i like going to sleep with the lightening storm the images along with the sounds are very relaxing the calling and messaging feature is great

play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen ', 'love the spot', 'easy to use easy to set up', 'i love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when i ask ', 'this product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable there is a card on the homescreen called things to try it is an ad for other alexa services you can try you can turn off all the other homescreen cards but not this one by default the homescreen cards cycle automatically which is incredibly annoying there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only cycle once instead of cycle continuously but critically this setting does not work my unit has been set to cycle once and the cards still continue to cycle all the time have rebooted the device re set etc etc until these two obvious software issues are fixed in my opinion the product is useless ', 'great deal on prime day', 'no problem', 'excelente

product and i like the screen for a alarm clock', 'such a fun easy and convenient device to have around the house no need to pick up my phone to look something up just a few words and the world is at your fingertips the speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp the price is right for a device like this ', 'a great replacement for the bedside alarm clock which had a funny habit of going off at am every time the cleaning ladies came through we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off while leaving the fan running only gripe would be the mic sensitivity which does not appear be as good as the view or gen it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself ', 'this product has made my life much simpler with a little one i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on off or up down is a breeze the screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news ', 'works well and was easy to set up ', 'love my spot it now acts as my new alarm ',

guy ', 'product turns on randomly and sometimes at night', 'i used it as an alarm clock i lov it', 'it was much smaller than i was expecting for the cost ', 'i m amazed', 'alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on iheart radio or spotify i want plus when i do get smart home devices she ll be even more useful to me she s really helpful with answering random questions the small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it s nice to have something to show time and pictures ', 'fun so far still learning how it all works', 'i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking cutting cleaning etc especially when our counters aren t very wide to begin with after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact i can honestly say i have no regrets while i probably wouldn t watch a movie i d been dying to see on this it s a great way to listen to music watch a quick youtube video etc i even attempted watching jaws on this and while it wasn t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do it wasn t as bad as one would think i would definitely recommend ', 'we love the echo spot i use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iheartradio radio while getting dressed ', 'it

can not scroll face cards without having the stupid try and ask alexa suggestions pop up yes you can have it scroll once and just stay on the clock but i like having other cards as well god its the worst and so irritating i got it super cheap so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a dot instead of a spot what a dumb move on amazons part ', 'love that i have command access to news such as bloomberg tv npr etc highly recommend that you gain access to alexa app before setting up device and get familiar with key features services such as setting up your daily commute if

bluetooth speaker setting timers alarms changing my thermostat on voice command tells me the weather sends hubby a grocery pick up list and i am sure million more things buy it you u will not regret

usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like yes you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still have not adding this setting clearly not going to happen

is my first alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it the biggest con with me is the drop in feature it is pretty creepy', 'the best thing since sliced bread ', 'can t be used as a baby monitor which is why i had purchased it i didn t realize this until i read the reviews on the alexa skill for syncing the nest cam considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix surprised amazon hasn t upgraded the software to allow more than minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the nest app ', 'would be stars if you could turn off the things to try screen i should have read up on this before buying the spot amazon please update to enable us to turn this off it is so extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see things to try ', 'love it so great to use ', 'i own of these amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool you can customize the screen contents but you cannot turn off there advertising things to try people will suggest that you can but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option moreover they should increase the size slightly and improve the audio speaker that would give you a star device right now i m debating whether to return all devices my wife says we should ', 'i never thought i was going to be that person that is completely connected i purchased this and another echo product on prime day and fell in love i have one in my office and one in our kitchen i have already used this for morning briefings from the news while i am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes the screen is big enough for me to easily read writing this was a concern for me i loved this so much i purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools note i did purchase camera covers even though there is a button to turn off the camera and microphone and it does not impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about there are work around ', 'love love love this i have an echo and

surprisingly good ', 'you are going to have to shell out an extra bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this my biggest gripe i already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand ', 'love it except that amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual i do not have hours to research websites plus more instruction from alexa on skills would be great we often get the answer i do not know that skill even though i have added it in the app i e kwikset or pizza hut ', 'such a handy item to have on my night stand she reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views ', '', 'i got this on prime day and figured i would see what all the hype is about honestly i did not really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird but honestly i love it like it or not this is the way the world is going so why not i loved it so much i ordered i did not get the show because it looks like it came from the is and is downright ugly i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway so the spot is screen does not bother me although it is very clear alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it is hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar where i can just say play any song i want and it will i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you do not know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much they also do not rotate when playing music i would love for it to display the weather as i listen to music the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to different places that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic i have this programmed for my parents fiances parents work and her work so it really works great the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot the dot lights up colors why can not the spot the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery overall it is a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around i am already looking at dash buttons smart plugs etc and when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can not tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration ', 'the screen response time is way better than i expected sound quality is good too also it s not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds ', 'love it ', 'i looooooove this thing watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen but other than that it is a great chachki toy ', 'we gave the echo spot as a gift to my mother in law she loves it she can play music of all genres easy for her to use ', 'very easy to set up does what is said it will very satisfied so far ', 'great product need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify time weather etc in hong kong but works fine now i used it as alarm clock music in bedroom love it ', 'i bought this to replace a dot in my bedroom already have a show and a couple of full sized echo units in my house the spot is okay for what it is two issues one minor and one major the minor one why include the huge bezel on the front why not take that space and make the display larger a total waste of usable space the major one also involves the show i am very used to these devices i do not need to see things to try whenever i use a voice command with it even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices i am not a child and i do not need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed why does not amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off i want to see a clock face period not these silly nanny reminders ',

fix one of them youtube and its a star item to alleviate sound i have paired with a blue tooth speaker right now this sits in my living area where i think it will shine is my office desk once there

great for what i use it for an alarm clock a weather station background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house my biggest gripe about the device and why i knocked a star off is that you can not turn off the suggestions on things to try it is an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you do not want to see as it cycles through content screens a software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and do not want to see in the content rotation ', 'can not turn of things to try on the screen

has some positives it is great at playing music and setting alarms i personally felt that i paid too much for this product as it was nearly half off on prime day literally the day after i purchased it

t regret it ', 'fairly useless ', 'bought the spot and loved it within months it started acting funny and would stop working called and they determined that it was overheating i was told to unplug and technical support would call within hours waited hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week a week goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions told to wait longer really unacceptable expected more from amazon find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance ',

before bed the screen is too small to watch shows it displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures my only complaint is that they do not add the stand as standard i did not need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed many people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i am not going to split hairs the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice i think amazon is working overtime on this project i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything i am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i am staying in a hotel and she is no where to be found alexa what time is it alexa ', 'when we were buying another product there was an option to

use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video much of the time it works well as alarm clock but there are some serious flaws particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake it doesn t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with people on different schedules try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying alexa set an alarm for am and then having alexa repeat ok alarm set for am not good i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid plain and simple this device needs to be brought into the s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone no thanks if i m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i m in the shower ', 'i bought this for my mother and she loves it i want to get one for myself now ', '', 'invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to creapy af', ' out of stars i have the original tall echo dots spots and show the only thing i am finding a problem with is the speakers in the spot

a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera and that works but the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video there is something about only audio that made alexa different no i some ways it is a tv that you can talk to ', 'it f sucks', '', 'love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs ', 'this thing is awesome for grocery lists paired with the anylist app the flash briefing is very good too my only complaint is

a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment but remember the original echo did not have what it has now when it first came out i see that amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon i am sure it will have all that we want very soon maybe even things we have not thought of i do wish it was a bit more user friendly i still have not figured out how to video chat with my cousin in north carolina who also has one and when i tried to call my son is dot it went to video chat immediately last i looked dots do not have video screens another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill i had enabled that was free so now he is a bit worried to use it again that needs to be fixed i do have to say that all in all i am very happy with my echo show ', 'i have not had it very long it is my

doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her echo buttons manual see step the device has potential given it has a big screen decent sound but for bucks i would never reccomend it even for the i spent i feel like i got shorted oh and lastly the device is pretty useless without a prime membership i linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker i went on the family account this one and got it to work minimal oh and even with our prime membership you have to have a music pass or something that is an extra a month leaving this item a subscription nightmare and a overpriced decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes i would give it zero stars if i could ', 'quite nice clear great sound ', 'versatile

love it ', 'our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full fledged tablet what fantastic potential these have for digital photo screen video calls easy accesss to music audio books etc however once we have them setup we discovered the huge lurking negative amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their alexa features you can turn off many other things in settins but you cannot turn off things to try instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says try amazon please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam ', 'the best part about owning this is that my mother

purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he would not feel left out and isolated they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so

what i did not know was the z wave lock and zigbee alexa hub were not compatible does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus if not i guess my choices are exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink return the whole alexa system and get something else i do not want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or i will be back here asking how to integrate two hubs the reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point is because i was afraid they would not operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something does not work ', 'this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life ', 'i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub i am in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home for the same price as some hub is and even less expensive in some other cases i got a hub that works with my devices plus it does a lot more i have not even had time to go through all the skills it has but i have already found myself using many of them when i started a search for a hub i was not even considering the echo in part because i did not know it was a hub but also because i did not really think i would find much use for another ai system if you are looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost is the same or less than other hubs oh and by the way for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb saw another that came with a smart plug given the price of these extras well that just put the echo plus over the top ', 'i am so happy that i purchased alexa when i recently saw this at a friend is home he played some music while talking about the product i love the sound love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question she responds immediately i have not been able to listen to my cd is for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it is not an issue any longer ', 'after we learned to use this we are still learning we are very pleased with echo plus', 'i love it used one like this in philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on prime day ', 'the speakers on these devices are surprisingly good the functionality of each echo device is fantastic ', 'as advertised connected my smart bulbs with no problems ', 'it works perfect ', 'love warehouse buys if this was just in good used condition then new must be newer than new seriously this one was perfect not a mark on it anywhere great buy ', 'alexa is awesome the first day i got my echo plus i found out things that she can do that i didn t think were even possible i highly recommend this product along with all the accessories ', 'ease of set up i ll have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home ', 'i try use with yale lock but isn t work', 'it seems to be ok but the instructions are weak and i can not seem to get it to work i am going to get my techy friend to help me out and i will update you later', 'i love everything about it i love that the echo plus turns on and off my light it can also dim them with voice commands i also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that i didn t purchased audibles for i like that it can play my music from amazon music pandora tunein i heart radio and spotify echo can even play my local radio station i love that the echo is connected to my tivo bolt this allows tivo to pause stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered the only three dislikes that i have is that if you re up too close or to far the echo doesn t respond so i think they need to improve the microphone and i wish the speaker was better the speakers are okay but could be improved also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet well the other day i received a red light right on my echo plus this error was sorry i m having trouble understanding you please try again later after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my internet and it was easy to find this out and i found it odd that my dot wasn t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network ', 'love everything about this ', 'perfect for controlling my tp link smart devises', 'love this thing easy to setup and looking forward to adding more smart devices to my home ', 'got it specifically to work with the august smart lock and it connected to it with ease definitely ties the smart home together ', 'sound very nice perfect for the price', 'love it it is number ', 'wonderful product love alexia', 'it has a nice speaker ', 'music mainly but still checking other features',

commands and interactions with smart devices around the house makes having an echo plus one of the best purchases i ve made ', 'definitely a really good buy for first time buyers of smart home stuff i bought ', 'i enjoy the various functions of the device', 'alread had echos and dots but the ability to control philips hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on prime day another fun product from amazon ', 'i purchased the echo plus with the build in hub so i could have the convenience of asking alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off philips hue light bulbs were placed in the fixtures that i wanted alexa to control and they all work great i already had an echo dot in my kitchen den area so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tp link plugs but the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus i am able to play music set my alarm get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices the echo dot requires a tp link plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with alexa and the echo plus with hub other than the high price of the bulbs i love my echo plus with built in hub ', 'easily configured hub capabilities excellent sound quality for the size of the unit ', 'works great in my large open room', 'fun', 'this is outstanding works awesome the music sound very clear and loud and alexa is very smart', 'i bought this specifically for the smart hub capability so far it has been great easy set up instructions for all the various brands compatible with it ', 'the sound is wonderful and it just plain works i wish it cost less but it is worth the cost especially on prime day ', 'comes with a hub got it during prime day for and a hue white bulb works great now i can add more stuff that required a hub ', 'got it for the smart hub and does exactly was it says turn lights on and off arm and disarm my security system and the thermostat is next great product ', 'very easy to set up great sound ', 'so far it is been very useful trying to

great things alexa can do ', 'this thing is awesome i got it on prime day for a great deal i wish i had purchased two i also bought the echo show version but the sound is not nearly as good as the echo plus the echo show came dented so i will be exchanging it i like the screen and many of the features so i will not be getting a refund it was still worth the price ', 'is great having a new friend', 'coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home', 'easy setup with great sound i would rate this unit a and a must have for the office and home l am looking add other

purchase ', 'love it ', 'i like the list ability and the music i can play i do not like that i can not create a playlist without using the app and even then alexa will not play my songs i have to do it through my tablet or phone i also do not like that alex can not print again it has to be done through the app ', 'it is a great bundle of fun music games questions etc i luv it turns off my smart

'this was a replacement it was really easy to set up i had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub but installation was easy and instructions were clear ', 'really cool device that does a ton of stuff fun games like jeopardy we used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges ', 'i ve been waiting for prime day to purchase an echo plus and now i m enjoying learning what alexa can do with a new sonos one and an echo dot i have the makings of a really nice and well integrated smart home love it ', 'i have not had it very long but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions ', 'although this is my second echo device i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation instructions as to the many functions of the device i purchased becausse of the sound quality but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device or at least point out where it can be found ', 'the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in our home i am a little disappointed that alexa is not as good at information requests as google but as a start on home automation she is very impressive ', 'i never had alexa before but the biggest reason i bought it was for youtube and apparently youtube stopped supporting it and that is why it will get stars it is mostly youtube is fault but i worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist', 'awesome loving alexa', 'no habla espanol', 'love the music the stories', 'it is fantastic ', 'like it but it will take time to setup all the skills i want simply because there are so many i already use music and flash briefing daily very satisfied i use this along with alexa app on my kindle hd ', 'wish it would have came with the lightbulb but otherwise works great fast delivery and i enjoy using it ', 'still haven t learn all the echo can do but so far quite pleased ', 'love it ', 'i can receive my cpr classical station great sound what i like least is the learning curve and my mistakes ', 'sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn t respond or you forget the correct command alexa turn on the living room lights oops i mean alexa turn on the family room lights i also never realized i call my couch a sofa some times unfortunately my alexa is confused by my changing names for where i sit ', 'no it is broke and i can not get help fixing or replacing it', 'i m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub so bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and i was looking forward to this feature being able to play music check the weather etc is fine ', 'sounds great have not used the hub yet', 'is as expected and more responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands ', 'sound is better', 'it is as if we are having a conversation with another person instantaneous response and the fact that it catches your command even when you are far from it is simply just amazing ', 'although i have not taken advantage of many of the echo is features there is one that bothers me it starts talking even when i have not said anything even close to the wake up word echo had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another device ', 'the echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use it plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things still learning what all it can do working very well so far ', 'we have used for last weeks we like it my children also like it alexa has become part of our family ', 'terrible stopped working after one day ', 'better sound than my echo dot simple to set up less than minutes ', 'nice toy to have around ', 'it does not speak in spanish i bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when i m not around no spanish ', 'love all the cool thing i can do ', 'great product', 'like it still working discovery really too soon to fully evaluate but looking forward to learning and using it ', 'when i got this echo i was excited to have a device with better sound than my dot and a hub to control some hue bulbs what i did not realize and also was not fully communicated to me is that you can not use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices if you do you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless i still love the echo and have zero complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device i am only disappointed with the hub is functionalities ', 'still needs some work on commands sound is equal in the regular echo so if you do not need a smart hub get a regular echo the sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but i mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear ', 'i love my echo plus i use it with my spotify account to find my phone make phone calls turn our lights off and on much more most importantly it reads story to my children they love it and that makes me happy ', 'excellent why didn t i think it is in the beginning i love it', 'bye bye philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge took a little tinkering had to rest the individual bulbs but works great no more philips hue bridge is not responding message ', 'works great exactly as described only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff ', 'i love it use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from', 'very easy to hook up download the app and it walks you through the setup', 'i am so disappointed in this product i tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed hours with amazon technicians resetting each of them the app did not connect the echo plus to the internet connection tried using the application on a phone a tablet and on a chromebook no luck there are no clean directions on the application probably sending this back to amazon mark this as not ready for prime time ', 'well behaved device that i enjoy using ', 'easy setup and sound quality ', 'i really love the hub feature', 'what a blast we love echo just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too ', 'love this ', 'great sound quality works well with smart home devices', 'use way more often than we used our google home ', 'mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result ', 'nice add on to a home what i do not like are the limitations for example world soccer it will not give you much info of sport teams other than american ', 'i was a little apprehensive about buying this because i saw reviews saying it sounds like crap i am no audiophile by any means so maybe it is that but i think it sounds great considering the size it fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear i have not had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands i have it paired to an ecobee my firestick and a phillip is hue light bulb i plan on adding devices as i go i love this thing and i am glad i scooped it up i have only had it around weeks will update if i run into issues ', 'i love my echo plus the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient to use outdoors ', 'great device my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me ', 'the alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work i was not aware of that disappointed', 'the echo plus is great so easy to set up and with the built in hub it connects to other alexa devices with a mere verbal command i am and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me have my lights integrated with alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks definitely recommend the echo plus ', 'works as advertised it says alexa is always learning that is great because i am just learning all the things alexa can do ', 'great love it ', 'wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item ', 'does not seem to hear as well as my nd generation echo and why is there no volume buttons on it ', 'a ', 'worked great the built in hub works great ', 'it knows everything we ask it to do havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase sound quality is excellent also', 'connecting and sound are perfect i only give because the is no internal battery if i disconnect to the power source it will be off ', 'it seems easy to stump alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer we admit that we have not explored all that is available through the echo one irritating issue is that alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system rather it refers you to the alexa app or help via a computer it was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful ', 'i like how easy it was to set up very easy to use and set up with other bluetooth devices ', 'ease of use and many tasks it will perform', 'i purchased the echo plus with built in hub during prime days sale it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi also connected it to a smart plug to control a light i love telling alexa to play music and she hears me from rooms away excited to learn new uses for it ', 'it was harder to setup then i thought it should be for some reason i had to default it twice had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices would be nice if it could interact with my xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras be nice set and disarm the alarm with alexa had to install a skill app to setup bulb whats that about you ship it with your product should have said alexa setup bulb or alexa find new bulb and alexa setup nest it is fine that you use third party apps but alexa should do the work for you ', 'nothing to dislike i love my new toy that has made my house a smart home ', 'the built in hub lacks some of the features geo fencing of the phillips hub otherwise would have given it stars ', 'the echo plus is used for leisure and pleasure i absolutely love it easy to set up and connect what a great addition to my listening pleasure i have not used it yet for other purposes ', 'arrived right on time and works as expected', 'it is like a remedial form of the star trek computer in your home', 'the echo part works fine the hue hub is a disaster it worked for a few months and then nothing i spent hours on the phone with tech support one y to have to send it in for repair i am now trying to reconnect my lights what a pain i am having to reset each light bulb it can take up to times to get it to reset i have spent hours on this i will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps ', 'i love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too great for family game nights', 'it was supposed to come with a free hue lightbulb on amazon prime day no light bulb arrived false advertising ', '', 'awesome ', 'have not had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect it will be on it is way back to amazon', 'this is the rd unit i purchased all the way from gen to the plus the only reason i purchased this is because it works so well and i wanted it in other rooms as well all my switches work great and i have had not issues i the past i did have some ghost commands when alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but i think some recent ipdates may have resolved this it just keeps improving over time not with call capabilities i work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest best way so far can t wait to see what they come up with next ', 'love it i play music everyday and voice activated makes it so easy', 'i can not get multiple profiles working it just spins when adding a nd user at pass device prompt', 'i love it using music and turning on and off light', 'it has great sound and very responsive to commands ', 'this thing is great has good sound and does everything i expected i have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarm com as well ', 'no problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great ', 'this is a very useful device i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house it works with all the

would ', 'i love my echo plus ', 'how can you not like the echo plus it has the built in hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices amazon makes a great product and i have not had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices echo dots etc ', 'i have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because i am just not good with electronics however this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the bluetooth in my sound bar for my tv which provides extra sound for music i can make calls and finally hear people when home i do not have cable only the paid apps like netflix and hulu so when alexa provided me news stations weather and other updates it was really great to hear i have linked all of my accounts to her she turns on my lights before i walk through the door she purchases re orders off of amazon for my pets and i heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to regardless if she was unplugged or not this is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone my tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her must buy ', 'i love my echo plus and have cousins from italy here

product ', 'music news shopping list jokes games', 'works well need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well ', 'i will be returning it it is been nothing but annoying the hub can not be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge i can not even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues bottom line is it sucks as a hub it does not support z wave and zigbee which in fairness i knew in advance but when the one protocol it does support does not do many functions that a dedicated one will what is the point i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this does not i found that rather interesting ', '', 'the echo does not link to direct tv even though they said it would i have spent multiple hours on this made phone calls and texts also is missing free bulb ', 'still

it helps me turn light on and off and schedule doctor appointments using google voice phone and get my medical rides to and from hospitals plays music on cue from multiple web apps and watch videos as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off thank god no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights thank you amazon i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirm com to purchase more of each and some lights for rest of the house jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event really helped when all you earn a month is on ssdi thank you all again ', 'i am sure the echo is as cool as everyone says but i will not get to try this one even though i have a large covered porch the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for chance of rain and rain it did soaking the package i am not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is this order has been cursed from the beginning ordered as a birthday gift and delivery was not made on scheduled day now i get it and its rain soaked ', 'so far i love it it was easy to set up if i can do it anybody can speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command ', 'i am not tec smart enough to make it work at all will send it back if i cant get help my eco dot works just fine this is too complacated i just wanted a bigger speaker ', 'we are a long time amazon prime family many years but new to the alexa world and thought the purchase of alexa plus with hub and included phillips hue light bulb would be a great start alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning verbalize books playing music on command even linked to my sirrius xm account good daily stuff good sound but not bose but the ads say hub included so do not need anything else to operate devices well not so i understand there will be some differences in product device support the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on off dimming of the bulb the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge so it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes time the lights when you are away set color tones etc that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge was very disappointed to find that out after the fact to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs ', '', 'i love it but does not play well with my amazon prime many shortcomings and potential fees', 'item as described and delivered on time thank you', 'i bought of these plus echo dot nd generation on prime days love the echo plus easy to setup the reason for the star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free philips hue white a single led bulb works with amazon alexa there is no one to call to find out why ', 'product does not light bar never went orange i googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions i tried both product is defective', 'exactly what i wanted with speedy shipping thank you so much ', 'easy to install', 'i have an original echo and really like it i wanted another one for my basement i realize it is not a huge stereo with settings but it does not sound bad at all definitely does not take up much room great price for the echo plus on prime day i ordered two ', 'i bought this on prime day and saved lots i have large blue tooth speakers in my house that i used for years the echo plus was louder than all combined at the same time very impressed with the clarity and volume you will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio that s just a sad fact it ll play pandora and spotify but it s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple users will be disappointed to see that it s not as convenient as an apple deviceoverall i still loved the device but i ll be getting the dot which has an audio out jack as does the echo plus and just connect to external speakers', 'i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb the excited ended quickly i spend about a total of hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus everything i tried ended in a discovery failed message i tried to set this up over and over and over again i watched youtube videos i read set up websites i was the poster child of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work but also the problem not being operator error well after tech support staff and hr and mins of being on the phone it still did not work this product has tested my patience so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school the only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb the problem was not the bulb because before packing up the items i purchased another bulb and still alexa could not locate this device i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo the support person had the same thought maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can not get over the look of that hub it looks like a defuser i can not believe i did not find youtube videos that show the problems i did everything looked simple and seamless not the experience i had ok i am done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already ', 'got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event it sounds pretty good and works well so far ', 'very nice and its does not take up space', 'i am an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i have always loved it i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus let me tell you what great choice as much as i love my original echo the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable the sound is great and the fact that it is got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus ', 'received the wrong product was so excited to install it all excitement gone thank you amazon ', 'i m having trouble with it the alarm most of times doesn t work the timer doesn t ends and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable ', 'love it just wish i could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription', 'sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs ', 'i got it to try side by side with the echo originale they are essentially the same in dimension weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub as many folks already pointed out the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue z wave or anything else it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub for me the voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i do not really need the hub with less functionality in addition i do not think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs net net for me this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good with the original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these ', 'why do we need to buy a hub to get it to work with samsung tv is and many other devices i want my money back this thing will not even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub what is the point of having a hub that does not support half the devices out there do not buy this thing unless you want to spend another on another hub it will not work with many of your devices just by the echo or dot if you must but not this better yet get a google device they actually understand you when you talk ', 'i love it in my living room', 'absolutely love it only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable when playing music with bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs ', 'i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb when i got everything set up i realized the echo plus hub won t allow full functionality of the bulb all it does is turn the light on off and dim it will not change colors you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb i wish i d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights ', 'at a volume setting of half or less the speaker sounds like there is something rattling crackling or vibrating in it i would understand if the volume was set higher all speakers get distorted when over driven but this does not sound like this is an over driven case sounds like more of a rattle crackle possibly because the bass is too high learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics other than volume i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem ', 'the sound is fantastic for the classic music is like you have the orchestra at your home and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top but also you can tell alexa volume ', 'love alexa makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time', 'i was suppose to get the free lightbulb with purchase it did not come with echo upon reading more carefully it says to click a box to receive free bulb of course i want the free bulb who wouldn t just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many free bulbs away disappointed i have yet to set up my echo our first purchase on any alexia device debating if we want to keep it it did come quickly with my prime membership ', 'i bought this for myself and i didn t realize it had to be plugged in just to work it isn t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall it should ve been more clear when i bought it ', '', 'alexa helps with more than just lights or music it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing lol sweet love it so much so i purchased alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself when i got it he wasnt so keen on it but now its his best friend he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day as well as sang him happy birthday lolol he now has educated him self on things he never knew and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked love it and to think i was going to hate it ', 'incredible piece of technology i have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and sound more appealing it is no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons on the echo a large inconvenience and not as precise for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo nd generation the piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over this order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought i put the bulbs into my living room floor lamp turned on the light and all i had to do was say alexa connect my devices the default names for each bulb was assigned as first light and second light so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on off one of the lights by saying alexa turn off the second light in the alexa app i created a group with first light and second light and named the group the light so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say alexa turn on the light i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb i was surprised by that awesome you will feel like tony stark on this device i added quite a few skills like nothunderstorm sounds and quote of the day alexa always loads them up quickly adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership i was lucky to buy this for on prime day but i think for is it pretty expensive considering the echo is only in my opinion you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you taller and sound unit volume knob on top that you spin i think this is a huge benefit over buttons built in hub for hue bulbs after researching more there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups for me and my floor lamp it is just perfect i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now ', 'easy to install very clear speaker i took one star off because it was delivered late by ontrac like usual ', 'love love love', '', 'good product ', 'i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck or the color or the shape or even the way it smells but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up x is now to no avail i have other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly i have reset my phone galaxy s checked the app for updates i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt i work in the network technology industry for a living and have for over years now so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up the set up screen just continues to roll the dots around the screen for about minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close restart my phone and the echo and try again i figured x is was enough it should not be that hard a techie i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology i hope they will not call me i will tell em to send the product back ', 'pretty cool device still have a lot to learn but i am changing channels on my fios and getting info needed the

built in hub along with approximately in zigbee light switches the voice control is subpar even when it works and that is a rarity most often it does nothing i could not be more disappointed with this

speaker via the auxiliary jack when i did that the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device ', 'listens well does way more than expected love her ', 'we are still testing this one out

them on but we have been able to manage and fix it i mean it is convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc i am just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now ', 'works great having fun playing music checking weather a king questions ',

sound system to play prime music which my google home mini can not do it works well ', 'this is so much fun to play with i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell

thing ', 'i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i did not give it stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay to dollars more if it

is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the full size echo which has great sound quality ', 'very intelligent love the songs ', 'review', 'i love my echo dot the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timers the list goes on and on definitely worth the money ', 'sound is terrible cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time ', 'easy installation and set up better sound from the echo dot smart speaker very satisified with purchase ', 'i am spoiled by one downstairs so got this one for upstairs to listen to music etc while i walked on the treadmill ', '', 'the commands alexa requires are too specific i find google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what i am asking for ', 'handy as hell recommend', 'i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot alexi is not very smart out of questions i have asked i get the i am not sure half the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying i am not sure the music is great and works well for that all in all so far it is been a very frustrating experience ', 'we are still in the discovery phase but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed ', 'totally gets out sense of humour', 'we put one in the bedroom it plays music and tells us the weather it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning it is better than a clock radio it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites it can even tell jokes i do not know how i got along without it before now amazing ', 'i like the echo but not sure about the dot i use it a lot for music and audio books the sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model i have not decided if i will keep it or not ', 'love it i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes we love it ', 'better sound ', 'got this for my nd echo in the house i already have the regular echo the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound ', 'i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i would get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack when i did that the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device ', 'listens well does way more than expected love her ', 'we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and will not turn them on but we have been able to manage and fix it i mean it is convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc i am just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now ', 'works great having fun playing music checking weather a king questions ', 'small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you ask my only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker', 'alexa is perfect for people like me living alone at least i have someone to talk to to keep my sanity though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers ', 'small footprint nice clarity ', 'easy set up', 'great addition to my alexa base using it in my guest bedroom for music clock and info dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it is a great value', 'i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just did not work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound ', 'i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini can not do it works well ', 'this is so much fun to play with i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial i have not used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts ', 'easy to set up and does everything it s a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase ', 'a great product for the price works well ', 'perfect for a home office', 'weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both i think it is lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices ', 'it does what it is suppose to do great product ', 'i love this item and being able to hear any kind of music i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another ', 'love the dot', 'great item i am so glad i made the purchase and on prime day ', 'i am still learning how to use it i figured out it can read my kindle books to me which is a real bonus ', 'love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house ', 'so far so good not to tech savvy so i am still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so far easy to use lots of apps that it can use i will have to play with it some more but its fun to have ', 'echo dot responds to us when we are not even talking to it i have unplugged it it feels like it is spying on us ', 'not connected to my phone playlist ', 'i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying of them for my home my wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer this has been a godsend we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speaker stereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you will not regret this at all ', 'perfect fast shipment and packaging worked as intended ', 'alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time', 'love it ', 'i am addicted to this thing ', 'i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i did not give it stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay to dollars more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it i am just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does not take up a whole lot of space ', 'so far all i can say is i love it', 'love my dots easy to use i have two plus the echo spot one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music amazon iheart radio pandora ', 'great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home', 'i am obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you ', 'works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers ', 'easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do', 'we have so much fun with this so easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to alexa ', 'i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done ', 'we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price ', 'super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time it s great for my news updates too ', 'it works just like my other dots ', 'set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use ', 'the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality a massive difference from the alexa which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this won t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve ', 'i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine ', 'i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder ', 'too soon i am still learning what i can do with it ', 'enjoying it and still learning all the commands ran into one frustrating issue it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household ', 'i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices', 'works great ', 'i like almost everything', 'amazing it has helped me become better organized gives me traffic updates weather updates and helps me maintain a good fast morning routine ', 'my kids love alexa skills are amazing would like to see her get a

not sound loud enough ', 'love alexa i own and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit ', 'as expected', 'i didn t order it', 'i love this technology i am older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room ', 'use as my rd dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and does not have access to phone ', 'amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do', 'does what i expected and more ', 'the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has and even that one has bluetooth and doesn t need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it ', 'i have a friend now ', 'it s easier to do things with it', 'good device', 'overall love it there are just some commands which are not effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom to what is being asked ', 'these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house lol we would not be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs ', 'works great love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices ', 'i love it it is just what i thought it would be i am addicted ', 'works beautifully excellent sound ',

it s great that i was able to set that as default there s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he s a lot more calmer and doesn t bark when we lock the door and start walking away it s a must have ', 'love it it works great alexa still has some problems but it is getting better every day i am not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine not perfect but good ', 'this is my second echo to purchase the price was so cheap i am seriously

my lights my thermostat my front door dead bolt the cameras and i love listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems ', 'only complaint i have is that the sound quality is not great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and do not mind the audio quality but if you are bothered by that kind of thing i would go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers ', 'good']\n"
